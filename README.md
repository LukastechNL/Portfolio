# Portfolio

This is my collection of the projects I did over the course of the summer 2024 techNL program.

## Replit Codes

Some of the replit files I've made are a basic number guessing game a calculator, and some graphs. I've placed all the codes into one document. The code is very simple and could definitly be better or simpler.

## Onshape

Another thing I've made is a 6 sided die with Onshape. The link to that is [here](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/3b6a3761a6de9c01f92a192b/w/79694f91b6f7ae26bb73206a/e/c594bbc7e111e486c1c6718b?renderMode=0&uiState=669911e9d470d51ad9ff3eb8)
