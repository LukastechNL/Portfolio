# Portfolio

This is my collection of the projects I did over the course of the summer 2024 techNL program.

## Replit Codes

Some python projects made in Replit. I've placed all of the codes into one document. The projects made are listed below

### Number guessing game
The user guesses a number that is generated by the code

### Calculator
The user inputs the type of calculation they want; [+,-,/,*] and then the numbers they want. *Can only do two numbers*

### Graphs
Some graphs the were used to practice data visualisation *The final graph's code may need to be adjusted to compare different things*

## Onshape

Another thing I've made is a 6 sided die with Onshape. The link to that is [here](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/3b6a3761a6de9c01f92a192b/w/79694f91b6f7ae26bb73206a/e/c594bbc7e111e486c1c6718b?renderMode=0&uiState=669911e9d470d51ad9ff3eb8)
